## 1. Ping Utility
A simple command-line application that performs continuous ping tests to a specified host, 
providing real-time feedback and logging results for later analysis.

### Features:
- Continuous Pinging: Sends ping requests at a specified interval.
- Customizable **Timeout**: Set a timeout for each ping request.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of ping failures and exceptions.
- **Logging**: Records ping results to a log file for future reference.
- **Statistics**: Displays success rates, minimum, maximum, and average roundtrip times.

### Usage:
1. Go to the project folder.<br/>
2. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run <host> <timeout> <logFilePath>
```
- `host`: IP address or domain to ping.
- `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds for each ping request (optional, default: 1000ms).
- `logFilePath`: Path to the log file (optional, default: ping_log.txt).

## 2. Port Scanner
Utility that scans devices in **local network** for open, closed, or error-prone 
**ports** within a given range.

The program displays results in a clear, **tabular format**, 
allowing users to quickly identify active services on networked devices. 
Additionally, it includes an option to **identify devices** by MAC address, 
displaying manufacturer details to enhance device recognition.

### Features:
- **Device Selection**: Scans local network for devices, displaying IP, MAC, and manufacturer.
- **Manufacturer Lookup**: Queries MAC address details to identify device manufacturers.
- **Port Scanning**: Tests for open and closed ports over a specified range.
- **Progress Visualization**: Displays a progress bar during the scan for real-time feedback.
- **Detailed Report**: Outputs port status in ranges for easier readability.

### Usage:
1. Run the program, and select a device from your local network.
2. Specify the start and end ports to scan.
<p>The program will display real-time progress and present a summary report.</p>

### Example:
