# File System Operations

[//]: # (__________________________________________________________)
## 1. File System Information

#### Task:
Write a program with 2 functions:
1) Output all file extensions inside a folder. The path to the folder must be passed to the function
2) Output information about all storage devices on your computer in the following format: name, size, available space

#### Technologies:
- Console application
- `DriveInfo` & `DirectoryInfo` & `FileInfo`

#### The implementation is in the next project:
- Application logic - [FsInformation](FsInformation)
<br><br>

## 2. Folder and File Renamer
This program renames folders and files in a specified directory with the chosen formatting style, 
supporting recursive renaming if needed. Supported formats include **CamelCase** and **snake_case**.

#### Task:
Recursive or single-level renaming of folders and files.<br>
Supported formats:
- **CamelCase** â€“ capitalizes the first letter of each word, removing spaces.
- **snake_case** â€“ uses underscores to separate words and lowercase letters.

Displays the final folder structure using the tree command.

#### Usage:
Run the program.
1. Enter the **directory path**.
2. Choose the renaming format:
   - **CamelCase**
   - **snake_case**
3. Specify whether renaming should be **recursive** (for nested directories).
4. The program outputs the final folder and file structure.

#### Example:
```console
Enter folder path:
C:\TestFolder

Select formatting type (CamelCase or SnakeCase):
CamelCase

Rename recursively? (yes/no):
yes

File and folder structure after renaming:
C:\TestFolder
â”‚   ExampleFile.txt
â”‚   AnotherFile.doc
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€SubFolder
        NestedFile.png
```

#### Technology:
- System.IO
- Strategy design pattern

#### Notes for Extending:
To add new formats, create a new class implementing the `IFormatStrategy` interface and specify the format logic.
